Privacy Policy for Check Please

Last Updated: 10/28/2024

Introduction

Welcome to Check Please, an app by The Forgemind designed to help users manage and split restaurant bills with ease. Your privacy is very important to us, and we are committed to protecting any information we collect about you. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect and how we use it.

Data Collection and Usage

Check Please accesses only the device’s camera to allow users to take photos of their restaurant bills for itemized tracking and bill splitting. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data. Your photos are processed solely on your device using image processing models integrated within the app. We do not send or store any image or data outside your device.

Advertising

Check Please is entirely ad-free. We are committed to providing a seamless user experience without any third-party advertising or tracking.

No Data Sharing

We do not collect any personally identifiable information from our users, nor do we share any data with third parties. The app is designed to function locally on your device, meaning no data is uploaded to external servers.

Children’s Privacy

Check Please is designed for users of all ages, but we prioritize privacy and data security for all, including children. Since we do not collect or store any personal information, we comply with the requirements of children’s privacy protection laws worldwide.

Data Security

Since Check Please does not store or transmit any user data, data security risks are minimized. All image processing happens directly on your device, ensuring your data remains private and secure.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect any changes to our data practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates will be posted within the app and on our website. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes.
